### Motivation
I created the project soly for my personal use. But I make it open source so that anyone can use it. I have always found writing in a diary to be a therapeutic and rewarding experience. It helps me process my thoughts, reflect on my experiences, and gain insight into my emotions and behavior. However, I often struggle to maintain a consistent diary-writing habit due to the inconvenience of pen-and-paper journaling. I wanted to create a digital diary that would make it easier and more enjoyable to write regularly, with features like automatic reminders, goal tracking, and mood visualization. I hope this project will help others cultivate a daily writing practice and experience the benefits of journaling for themselves.
